<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This study reports the findings from two surveys of Kansas
hospitals, municipal and county governments, and school districts concerning their
preparedness for the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem. The first survey was conducted in the first
quarter of 1998, while the second was conducted in the last quarter of 1998. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The overall purpose of these surveys is to present information that
is useful to decision makers in addressing Y2K preparedness among these local
organizations in Kansas. In providing this information, this report assesses the degree of
preparedness for the Year 2000 problem in these four categories of organizations,
determines the extent of change in the preparations of these organizations when comparing
the findings of the first survey with the findings of the second survey, and analyzes
what, if any differences there are by population characteristics. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">A comparison of the findings of the first and second surveys shows
that hospitals, counties, cities, and school districts have improved their Y2K
preparedness. Variables that were strong to moderate predictors of Y2K preparedness in the
first survey (population, supervising board awareness, and type of organization) are
generally not as strong of predictors of Y2K preparedness in the second survey. These
findings suggest that Y2K preparedness is beginning to permeate into all different types
of local organizations. Hospitals continue to lead other organizations in their aggregate
level of Y2K preparedness, however, counties, cities, and schools have improved their
levels of Y2K preparedness and in some areas, surpass the levels of Y2K preparedness of
hospitals. In addition, organizations in smaller communities still tend to lag behind
those in larger communities, but the extent to which they are &quot;behind&quot; has
declined.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">While there is considerable evidence of improvement, the second
survey still shows that there are many areas of concern. At this late date, there is still
a substantial percentage of local organizations that are in the beginning stages
(awareness or assessing) of Y2K preparedness especially in the areas of automated
computerized systems (embedded systems) and external business support systems.
Administrative systems show the highest levels of Y2K preparedness for all four types of
organizations.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Perhaps the most pressing problem that needs immediate attention is
in the area of contractual liabilities related to outside vendors being contractually
bound to insure that their systems and services will continue to operate properly after
the year 2000. Less than half of all organizations have made these types of contracts.
When broken down by organization type, about 33% of counties and 35% of hospitals have
made some determination of contractual liabilities. Only about 25% of schools and
municipalities have made some determination. Because of the legal implications that are
expected to result from Y2K problems,<strong> programs need to be initiated as soon as
possible to address this area of concern</strong>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Another cause for concern is in the area of contingency planning.
Only 47% of organizations have an emergency plan in the event of Y2K related failures.
Perhaps even more disturbing is that of those organizations that are uncertain of the
possible impact of Y2K on critical services, 61% do not have an emergency plan.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Finally, among all four types of organizations, there is an
increasing percentage that are uncertain of the impact that Y2K will have on their ability
to deliver mission critical services. This is disturbing because, it suggests that the
more activities these organizations engage in to address Y2K problems, the less certain
they become that their efforts will be enough. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">All this strongly suggests that efforts on the part of all concerned
need to intensify between now and the end of the year to ensure that these organizations
are prepared for the year 2000.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Section 1: Introduction</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The &quot;Year 2000 Problem&quot; has been recognized in scholarly
and professional writing for over a decade (de Jager, 1993). Many undesirable consequences
can flow from the &quot;Y2K&quot; problem, as it will be called here. Best said Y2K is a
very simple problem with staggering implications. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">When programmers first designed information technology still in use
today, two digits (mm/dd/yy) were used instead of four (mm/dd/yyyy) to conserve memory
which was initially very expensive. Many of the two digit systems and software calculate
the length of time between dates by subtracting two-digit years from each other. Software
performing arithmetic operations or sorting on date fields may fail or yield incorrect
results when working with the year beyond 1999. If an application uses a two-digit date
format, the computer may read &quot;00&quot; as &quot;1900&quot; instead of
&quot;2000.&quot; This same error occurs with all types of systems including invoicing,
credit card transactions, inventory systems, databases and payrolls. In addition, data
files can be lost or corrupted.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Embedded Systems</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The problem extends beyond software and data integrity. At the heart
of the Y2K problem is the Achilles heel, the &quot;embedded chip.&quot; Almost every
electronic product used today relies on some type of embedded device. The first item that
comes to mind is usually a home or work based PC. But as we go through a normal working
day, our use of vehicle anti-lock brakes, fax machines, laser printers, telephones,
photocopiers, and the automated teller machine also involves interaction with embedded
systems. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The embedded chips are the micro-chips that drive much of the
technology used by government, healthcare and business as well. Chips in water and sewage
systems, pacemaker monitors, security systems, air traffic control units, credit cards,
automated factories and billing systems could all be negatively impacted by the Year 2000.
</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">According to Costis Toregas, President of Public Technology, Inc.,
experts predict that only about two percent of the 25 billion chips in use today will
fail. Since there is no way to tell which two percent will fail, it is necessary to test
systems with embedded chips and prepare contingency plans for any mission critical systems
with embedded devices. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Other Dates</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Attention to the Y2K problem naturally focuses on events occurring
near the beginning of the year 2000; however, problems can be encountered both before and
after the beginning of the century. Key dates other than 1/01/00 include:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">8/21/99 GPS rollover problems</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">9/09/99 End of file problem</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">10/01/99 Fiscal year end problem</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">1/4/00 First working day of the year problem</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">2/29/00 Leap year problem (phase I)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">12/31/00 Leap year problem (phase II)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Prior Findings</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">In this study, we are concerned with assessing the state of
readiness for the Y2K problem for Kansas county and municipal governments, hospitals and
school systems. An identical study was conducted in the first quarter of 1998. At that
time, the responses showed a wide range of results with some organizations being well
prepared and other organizations that had not started assessments. A summary of
organizations by type was as follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong><u>County governments</u></strong> reported the greatest
    level of Y2K awareness by their boards, and were relatively confident about their
    preparations for delivery of services. Over 80 percent of county governments had made an
    assessment of the Y2K. These organizations were the best prepared in assessment of
    relations with businesses that provide goods and services.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong><u>Municipal governments</u></strong> reported lower levels
    of confidence about preparedness in most areas as compared to the county governments.
    Nearly 25 percent of municipalities believed the Y2K problem will negatively impact
    administrative services. As of March 1998, approximately 37 percent of municipalities had
    developed plans to maintain critical services.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong><u>Hospitals</u></strong> (with county governments) reported
    the highest level of preapration in may aspects of delivery of services. Over 49 percent
    of hospitals were unsure if Y2K would negatively impact their critical systems and 11
    percent believed that Y2K would negatively impact critical service delivery. Forty percent
    of the hospitals did have contingency plans in place as of March 1998, to ensure that
    critical services would be maintained.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><strong><u>School Districts</u></strong> were the least likely to
    have done the vital assessment study or have boards which were aware of the Y2K problem.
    Only three percent of schools believed that Y2K would impact critical services. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Municipalities and County Governments</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Cities and counties are faced with not only business risks but
public safety issues as well. Emergency response systems, police departments,
transportation control systems for streets, highways, mass transit and utilities are all
vulnerable. According to one city government official, their internal awareness program
has already begun to pay off. &quot;We have been discussing Y2K for many months, but it
was only after a half day training session with all our staff from the road crew to the
Mayor, that we began to see our city employees work together on Y2K solutions and
contingency plans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The National League of Cities (NLC), the National Association of
Counties (NACo), and the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) have
joined with Public Technology, Inc., a non-profit technology research organization to
launch the Y2K &amp; YOU campaign. The campaign is designed to help local governments
ensure that their communities are &quot;Y2K compliant&quot; and that public health and
public safety are not compromised. The campaign also includes a &quot;Y2K tool
kit&quot;and video which can be ordered for $27 by calling 1-800-784-8976. Association
members may receive free copies of the Y2K tool kit by e-mailing their name, title,
jurisdiction name, and address to y2k@pvcla.com.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Lubbock, Texas has received national press attention for their Y2K
awareness and contingency preparedness efforts. Bob Cass, Lubbock city official, testified
before the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000. &quot;I believe the primary reason
the Senate Staff asked us to be present was the fact that we ran a simulation that
anticipated various Y2K failures on December 31, 1999,&quot; said Cass. The complete
findings and examples of the Y2K drill can be found at: </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><strong>http://y2k.ci.lubbock.tx.us/excersise.htm</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The city government in Lubbock sees the Year 2000 as an opportunity
to increase citizens awareness about emergency preparedness, and to make sure that their
municipal government is prepared to continue delivering the services their community
expects. According to the Mayor, &quot;the City of Lubbock is taking measures to prepare
for the worst case scenario, but we are not forecasting this outlook on Y2K. We expect
very few disruptions caused by January 1, 2000.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Hospitals</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Hospitals face a unique challenge with regard to the year 2000. All
businesses face a financial risk, but hospitals must also address patient safety concerns.
Dr. Kenneth Kizer, VA Undersecretary testified to Congress last summer that Y2K could
cause radiation machines to emit the wrong doses of radiation or an ICU unit could
inaccurately read a patients heart rhythms unless the software was reprogrammed for the
year 2000. In addition, hospitals must assess Y2K risks with outside parties including
pharmacies, pathology laboratories, outside medical suppliers and emergency crews.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Of those hospitals that have taken a very active approach concerning
Y2K, it appears clear that the Board of Directors had a high degree of involvement and
financial support for the project. &quot;We put people in charge of certain Y2K projects
and set deadlines,&quot; said one Y2K coordinator. &quot;There are 101 things that people
would rather be doing than Y2K but, you have to make it the number one priority if you
expect to succeed&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Another important factor in addressing Y2K seems to include an
employee education campaign and a good public relations program. &quot;People are calling
our hospital wanting answers&quot; said one western Kansas Hospital Administrator,
&quot;the staff knows that all inquiries are ultimately referred to certain legal or
public relations experts on staff.&quot; Internal Y2K messages have been disbursed through
bulletin boards, presentations, global e-mails or internal publications to ensure that the
hospital staff understands the seriousness of the problem and the importance of
consistency in spreading the Y2K message. An intensive care unit supervisor believes
educating core emergency staff is critical, &quot;it's important that our nurses and
doctors understand the potential problems with Y2K so that should a situation arise due to
Y2K, we have backup procedures in place.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Schools</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Unlike hospitals, schools will not be expected to be open for
business on Saturday, January 1, 2000. Nonetheless, the schools will need to ensure that
student records, financial systems, heating and cooling systems and food service delivery
systems are compliant. The Department of Education is taking steps to ensure that all
elementary and secondary schools are prepared for the Y2K. The Department of Education
recommends that schools visit the Department's website: </font><a HREF="(www.ed.gov/y2l"></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></a><a href="http://www.ed.gov/y2k"><font face="Arial"><strong>http://www.ed.gov/y2k</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font face="Arial">On the site, educators will find &quot;Y2K Best Practices&quot; for
elementary and secondary school systems. The Department has also compiled a publication
entitled &quot;Year 2000 Compliance Guide of Elementary and Secondary Schools, &quot;
which can be ordered by calling 1-877-4ED-PUBS. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Section 2: Study Methods</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This study reports the findings from two surveys of Kansas
hospitals, municipal and county governments, and school districts concerning their
preparedness for the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem. The first survey was conducted in the first
quarter of 1998, while the second was conducted in the last quarter of 1998. The findings
of the first survey were reported to the State of Kansas in the Docking Institute study
&quot;Year-2000 Readiness of Kansas Public Institutions: Hospitals, Local Governments, and
Schools.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This report assesses the degree of preparedness for the Year 2000
problem in these four categories of organizations, determines the extent of change in the
preparations of these organizations when comparing the findings of the first survey with
the findings of the second survey, and analyzes what, if any differences there are by
population characteristics. For purposes of comparison, both questionnaires (Appendix A)
contained the same six major sections:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">1. General questions</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2. Information technology for critical services</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">3. Systems that may process dates</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">4. External business support</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">5. Administration</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">6. Contact data</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The format for the questions in sections two through five were based
on a continuum with response categories ranging from &quot;implemented&quot; (i.e., the
problem is regarded as solved) to &quot;no activity&quot; (i.e. the organization has not
begun to deal with the problem). The response categories were defined as:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em><strong>Implemented</strong>: implemented converted or replaced
    platforms, applications, databases, utilities, and interfaces. Ready to implement data
    exchange contingency plans, if necessary.</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em><strong>Validating</strong>: Testing, verifying, and validating
    converted or replaced platforms, applications, databases, and utilities. Testing the
    performance, functionality, and integration of converted or replaced platforms,
    applications, databases, and utilities. Testing the performance, functionality, and
    integration of converted or replaced platforms, applications, databases, utilities, and
    interfaces in an operational environment.</em></font></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em><strong>Renovating</strong>: Converting, replacing, or
    eliminating selected platforms, applications, databases, and utilities. Modifying
    interfacing.</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em><strong>Assessing</strong>: Assessing the Year 2000 impact on the
    organization. Identifying critical services and processes, developing inventories and
    analyzing systems supporting critical services, and prioritizing conversion or
    replacement. Developing contingency plans to handle data exchange issues, lack of data,
    and bad data. Identifying and securing the necessary resources.</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em><strong>Awareness</strong>: Defining the Year 2000 problem and
    gaining executive level support and sponsorship. Establishing a Year 2000 program team and
    developing an overall strategy. Ensuring that everyone in the organization is fully aware
    of the issue.</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em><strong>No Activity</strong>: Have not begun to assess if the
    organization has a Year 2000 problem.</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em><strong>Not Applicable</strong>: This question is not applicable
    to the activities of the organization.</em></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">This framework has been used widely in the computing industry as a
standard for expressing the stage of an organization's encounter with the Y2K preparations
(see, e.g., Hall, 1998). For the first section, question response categories were answered
&quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;don't know.&quot; This format was also used in
one question of the section on external business support. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The first questionnaire was administered during the first quarter of
1998. A total of 848 questionnaires were sent. After two mailings, 633 usable surveys were
returned, for a response rate of 75%. The second survey was administered in the last
quarter of 1998. A total of 848 questionnaires were sent. After three mailings, 700 usable
surveys were returned for a response rate of 83%. The response rates for each type of
organization are shown in Table 1. The relatively high response rates (over 50% for each
category and 75% and 83% overall) suggest the surveys are broadly representative of
counties, cities, school districts, and hospitals. Further analysis of the demographic
characteristics of these organizations suggests no apparent response bias by population
and region. Inasmuch as the attention of this study is on Kansas institutions, inference
to counties, cities, school districts, and hospitals outside of Kansas is not appropriate.

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>Section 3: Survey Results</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A comparison of the findings of the first and second surveys shows
that hospitals, counties, cities, and school districts have improved their Y2K
preparedness. Variables that were strong to moderate predictors of Y2K preparedness in the
first survey (population, supervising board awareness, and type of organization) are
generally not as strong of predictors of Y2K preparedness in the second survey. These
findings suggest that Y2K preparedness is beginning to permeate into all different types
of local organizations. While this is an improvement, the second survey still shows that
there are many areas of concern. At this late date, there is still a substantial
percentage of local organizations that are in the beginning stages (awareness or
assessing) of Y2K preparations. This is a cause for concern because most consultants
capable of providing Y2K services to these local organizations are booked well into the
year 2000. Whether these organizations have the local capacity to address their Y2K
preparedness is a question that these surveys do not address, however, the Chief
Information Technology Officer of the State of Kansas is undertaking a statewide effort to
provide local organizations with additional information to facilitate Y2K preparations. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1" face="Arial"><strong>What Kinds of Organizations Are in Trouble?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">An urgent question for policymakers is, of course, the
identification of organizations that show a low level of Y2K preparedness. In the first
report, we noted that organizations with a low level of Y2K preparedness could be
characterized as:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Having significantly lower governing board awareness.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Being more likely to be a rural community. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Being more likely to be a school district.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 1 shows the overall response pattern to the question
&quot;Have you made an assessment of the ability of your computer systems to correctly
process the Year 2000?&quot; Whereas only 65% of local organizations had done so in the
first survey, in the second survey over 88% report that they have done an assessment of
their computer systems. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="y2k2imgs/fig02.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="398" HEIGHT="307"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 2 shows that governing board awareness is still important for
predicting if the organization has done a Y2K assessment. In the first survey, 78% of
organizations whose supervising boards were aware had done a Y2K assessment. In the second
survey, this percentage increases to 92%. For those local organizations whose governing
boards are not aware, the picture has improved since the first quarter of 1998. In the
first survey, only 46% of those organizations whose supervising boards were not aware had
done an assessment, while in the second survey, this percentage increases to 63%. The bad
news is that 37% of these organizations have not done Y2K assessment. These findings
continue to show the importance of supervisory board awareness for Y2K preparedness in
local organizations. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="y2k2imgs/fig03.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="398" HEIGHT="307"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 3 shows the relationship between assessment and the
population of the community. For each population category, there has been an increase in
the percentage of organizations that have done an assessment when comparing the findings
from the first survey with the second survey. While organizations in the smallest
communities are still the least likely to have done a Y2K assessment, the percentage of
organizations in the smallest communities that have done an assessment increases from 45%
to 79%. This is a significant increase in less than one year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Figure 4 shows the relationship between assessment and the type of
organization. The first survey showed that both school districts and municipalities lagged
behind the efforts of hospitals and counties. The responses in the second survey show that
these two governmental units have caught up to hospitals and counties (over 80%).
Significantly, almost all hospitals have done an assessment.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">We begin analyzing the results of the survey by examining the
difference between the first and second survey for the following five general topic
questions.</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">&quot;Adverse Impact on Services&quot;: Will the Year 2000 computer
    processing problem adversely effect the delivery of critical services like water,
    electricity, sewer, law enforcement, fire protection, emergency medical services, medical
    equipment operation, health care, etc.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em>&quot;Adverse Impact on Administration&quot;: Do you expect that
    the Year 2000 problem will negatively impact administrative services such as billing
    systems?</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em>&quot;Emergency Plan&quot;: Do you have a plan that will allow
    you to maintain critical services in the event that any system fails?</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em>&quot;Fee Increase&quot;: Do you expect that programs to mitigate
    the Year 2000 problem will cause your organization to raise taxes, fees, or rates?</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em>&quot;Board Awareness&quot;: Is your supervising board aware of
    your organization's Year 2000 situation?</em><br WP="BR2">
    </font></li>
</ul>

<p><em><font face="Arial">Table 2 shows the patterns of responses on each of these five
questions for both surveys. Except for the last question on board awareness, the response
patterns from both surveys are similar. A somewhat disturbing development in the second
survey is that there is an increase in the percentage of local organizations that simply
do not know if Y2K will have an adverse impact on the delivery of critical services. This
percentage increases from 36% in the first survey to 42% in the second survey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Given this level of insecurity, it is also discomforting that the
percentage of organizations with an emergency plan only increases from 37% on the first
survey to 47% on the second survey. Still less than half of all organizations lack
contingency plans to address emergencies due to Y2K. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">On the positive side, both surveys indicate that only 5% of
organizations expect a fee increase because of Y2K problems.<a HREF="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
In addition, in the second survey over 79% of local organizations did not think that Y2K
will adversely affect administration. This is an increase of 19% when compared to the
first survey. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font SIZE="-1" face="Arial"><img src="y2k2imgs/fig05.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="398" HEIGHT="307">Finally, in
the first survey, 41% of organizations reported that their supervising board was not aware
or that they did not know if their supervising board was aware (about 20% each). In the
second survey, this percentage drops to a total of 14% of all organizations. About 6%
report that their supervising board is not aware and 8% report that they don't know
whether their supervising board is aware of their organization's Y2K problems. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font SIZE="-1" face="Arial">For the delivery of critical services, we explore the
question as to whether certain types of organizations are more likely to expect Y2K to
hamper their ability to deliver critical service? Figure 5 shows that consistent with the
first survey, hospitals and schools are least certain of the impact of Y2K on their
critical services. Over 55% of hospitals and 50% of schools are uncertain if Y2K will have
an adverse impact on the delivery of critical services. This is in comparison to less than
35% for counties and cities. Municipalities continue to be the most certain that they will
not experience service problems from Y2K. Only 33% of cities are uncertain that Y2K will
have an adverse impact on critical services. Significantly, Figure 5 shows that consistent
with patterns noted in Table 2, this growing uncertainty is consistent across all
organizational types.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="-1" face="Arial">For emergency planning, we explore the question of whether
certain types of organizations are more likely to have an emergency plan in the event of
Y2K problems. The answer is yes. First, about 68% of hospitals have an emergency plan,
compared to 37% of counties, 40% of schools and 47% of cities. Second, those organizations
in the most populous areas are more likely to have an emergency plan. About 55% of
organizations with populations of 7,204 and above have an emergency plan, compared to 46%
for populations between 945 and 7,203, and only 38% for those under 945. Third and most
disturbing, is that of those organizations that are uncertain of the possible impact of
Y2K on critical services, 61% do not have an emergency plan. (see Figure 6). Even those
organizations that answered no to the question of whether Y2K would adversely impact their
critical services, are more likely to have an emergency plan (about 51%). </font></p>

readiness?&quot;. The individual items are:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em>&quot;Telephone&quot;: Switchboard/PBX (telephones)</em></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><em>&quot;Security&quot;: Security Systems (door locks, card readers,

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The responses for these questions are shown in Table 4 (next page).
The most significant aspect of Table 4 is for each system, the percentage of organizations
responding not applicable declines between the first and second surveys. For example, the
percentage reporting not applicable for telephone systems declined for 55% in the first
survey to 35% in the second. With a decline in the percentage of organizations stating not
applicable, it makes sense that there was an increase in the percentage reporting some
level of Y2K preparation activity in the second survey. For example, with HEVAC systems,
the percentage assessing went from 12% in the first survey to 24% in the second. Likewise,
the percentage reporting that they have implemented their HEVAC Y2K preparations increases
from 6% to 15%. This consistent pattern across each computerized system suggests that
education is extremely important to understanding the types of systems that may be
effected by Y2K problems. In the first survey, organizations may not have been aware that
systems like these could be effected by Y2K problems.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">For purposes of this set of analyses, we have combined the responses
implemented, validating, and renovating into one category labeled &quot;acting.&quot;
Assessing and awareness are combined to create the category &quot;starting,&quot; while no
activity and not applicable are combined to create &quot;no activity.&quot; We have done
this to simplify the graphs and to more clearly show the patterns of relationships. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">The first survey found that on most of these issues, hospitals were
most likely to be addressing Y2K problems and that schools were the least likely. In
addition, the first survey found that organizations from smaller communities were the less
likely to be addressing these areas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The second survey found patterns of responses very similar to the
first survey. For example, Figure 9 shows the relationship between telephone systems and
organization type, while Figure 10 shows the relationship between telephone systems and
population. Over 68% of hospitals are acting on Y2K problems in their telephone systems,
while only 36% of schools and 24% of counties and municipalities are acting. Population
has a strong effect on addressing phone systems' Y2K problems. Over 50% of organizations
from communities of more than 7,204 are acting, while only 22% of organizations from
populations of less than 944 are acting. Significantly, this latter result is not
surprising given that organizations in more populated areas are likely to be larger than
those in small communities, and thus have more technologically complex phone systems. </font></p>

the population of the service area would affect security system preparedness. Figure 11

critical in hospitals and are a significant factor for schools, where failures can close
schools or make the environment uncomfortable. Figure 12 shows the impact of organization
type on HEVAC system preparedness. Hospitals are most likely to be acting (56%), while
school districts are the second most likely to be acting (37%). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Contracts are of considerable interest, inasmuch as it seems highly
likely that legal costs will be important in the aftermath of expected difficulties with
the Year 2000 transition (see Berghel, 1998 and Hock, 1998; for a seemingly extreme but
not unusual approach, see Koprowski, 1998). Table 6 presents the results for contracts.
Between the first and the second survey there has been an 11% increase in the
organizations that have addressed contractual liabilities associated with Y2K, however,
the vast majority of organizations have not done anything about contractual liabilities or
simply, don't know. When broken down by organization type, about 33% of counties have made
some determination of contractual liabilities and 35% of hospitals. Only about 25% of
schools and municipalities have made some determination. Because of the legal implications
that are expected to result from Y2K problems,<strong> these findings are a significant
cause for concern</strong>.</font></p>

showed a similar type of pattern. The organizational disparities were less pronounced for
Y2K preparation for payroll and storage systems. For example, over 80% of hospitals and
schools and 72% of counties and municipalities are in the acting stage of Y2K preparedness
for payroll systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="y2k2imgs/fig15.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="398" HEIGHT="307">One might expect, that
larger communities have larger and more complex administrative systems, and thus, might be
more prepared for Y2K problems. Figure 15 shows that this is the case for payroll systems.
While organizations in the smallest communities (100 to 944) are not as prepared (65%),
they are not significantly lagging behind their larger counterparts. All the other
population categories show between 75% and 83% of the organizations in the acting stage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In general, organizations in the smallest communities tend to lag
behind the larger communities by about 10% to 15% in administrative systems. This may be
due to the reality that many organizations in small communities may not possess automated
administrative systems.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial"><strong>Section 4: Conclusions</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In contracting for this report, the sponsors desired to present
information about the levels of Y2K preparedness that is useful to decision makers in
Kansas. Accordingly, our conclusions are concerned mainly with policy implications and
steps to take in the near future to continue to address the Y2K problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Although our study shows that in all questions and for all types of
organizations there are some respondents who feel that their state of preparation is
relatively good, there are significant numbers of organizations of all kinds that are only
beginning to attack the Y2K problem. This is especially the case for computerized systems
and external business support. Identifying these organizations and assisting them is a
major public policy issue. A brief article by Jones (1998) notes that organizations which
start later to fix the Y2K problem must devote a much higher percentage of information
systems staff time to the problem. Organizations starting in, e.g., December of 1998,
should expect to allocate roughly 60% of their staff time to the problem and even then a
solution is not at all guaranteed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A second possible policy area arises in the very high portion of
respondents of all categories who indicate that they either do not know or have not done
anything about their legal relationships with vendors. Not only may this be a signal to
policy makers that an educational effort is in order, but also lawmakers might wish to
consider possible legislation to control what might become a flood of Y2K-related lawsuits
that might appear in the courts not long after the year 2000 begins. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Taken together, there are some concrete steps in the form of
educational programs, like the conference sponsored by the Chief Information Technology
Officer, which are designed to provide local organizations with information and options
for effectively addressing Y2K problems. Similar types of efforts should continue
throughout 1999 to spur actions to assess and address possible Y2K problems, and after the
year 2000, to learn how local organizations are addressing problems caused by any Y2K
failures. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><br WP="BR1">
<br WP="BR2">
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is also a need for further study to chart the progress of
actions on the part of cities, counties, schools, and hospitals to address Y2K problems.
We suggest that additional surveys should be taken every six months to document the
progress and extent of Y2K activity. After the year 2000, another survey should be taken
to assess the impact of Y2K problems, their costs, and the effectiveness of programs to
address this issue.</font></p>
